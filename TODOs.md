# TODOs

List of todos

### README
- Upload processed data and pretrained weights to Google Drive (or any other), then link it to README
- Make sure that the outputs match actual results, and corresponds to in paper.
- (extra optional) Test and mention virtualenv.
- Better explanations on demo files

### comp_study/history
- Instead of hard-coded values, maybe use results from bench files, output by running other experiments? (or maybe it is fine as-is?)
- Save results as a table format (.tsv), instead of a command line log?

### f.pickle (comp_study/ks_acca)
- Different name / maybe run experiment without saving a file?

### Copyright comments in each file?
